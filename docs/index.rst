*"The impossibly small web framework for Python and MicroPython"*

Microdot is a minimalistic Python web framework inspired by
`Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_. Given its size, it can run on
systems with limited resources such as microcontrollers. Both standard Python
(CPython) and `MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_ are supported.
